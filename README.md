# Intro2ML
This project includes jupyter notebook files partially run on Google Colab, that where developed during the course of the Introduction to Machine Learning course 2019 at ETHZ.

The notebooks should be self-explanatory. Note that the data cannot be provided as the author does not own the rights of the data.
The code however, might provide a helpful indication of how to solve easy machine learning tasks.
